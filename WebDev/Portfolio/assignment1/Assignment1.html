<p class > Reading this article was very mind-opening to see how society has grown with technology and its improvement over time from when the author was first introduced to it. We come to see how in a sense we've lost a touch of creativity and our passion for customization for things we hold dearly, and showing that on the web has decreased compared to the glory days of Geocities and Myspace. The modern-day screen time consists of consuming silly videos and maybe posting your own and so much more. Even at that were not allowed the freedom nor did we care for it, like how it was with geocities and myspace being able to create your own personal site for whatever you desired. Although we have grown alongside the use of these devices to grow as individuals we have also done the exact opposite as well we have taken steps back from the personality of our online presence.  </p>
    
<p>	A quote that stuck to me because of the reality we are in with modern society where are author claims “Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre–social media internet. The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet. It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism” I was able to see how we are limiting ourselves and how we are losing the passion for personalizing our own web page at this current time it is more of a lost art something only people with the interest of web development pursue. The new Internet with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok feels more controlled and unlike the old Internet where people would create and build their websites click by click that form of self-expression had been ruined by modern Internet consumption. I feel like we are only doing worse as well as we now have even lost some of those personal sites created so long ago like the author had experienced. 
</p>

	Another recurring idea that kept lingering around was whether are apps better than these sites or vice versa. I started to think about how some aspects of these websites sound tedious where you go and spend time looking around for the things you enjoy but you do that as well on apps as you scroll and create your own personally designed feed as well as apps so there similar but something that hit me hard was the depth of personalization. As are author states “In the age of smartphones and apps, our agency is only more limited; even what we see is limited, restricted by the proprietary designs of a small handful of companies. As for customization, it’s even worse: I can’t change how Twitter or Facebook looks on my phone.” Something else hit me harder the platforms we use are being controlled by organizations that gain profit from our consumption and production on these applications. And even through all of that, we are controlled by what we can do, and speak. 
     
</p>

<p>In conclusion i think the author has many valid points in her text that can lead you the the realization of how the past was filled with free expression and diverse content, to what has now become controlled platforms owned by powerful individuals. Even though what we post now is whatever the heart desires in a sense its not the same we will always be limited by these applications unlike before when creating our own digital space meant something more. Now we can’t get that same kind of freedom due to the greed and corruption of big corporations that aim to control what we consume online.
