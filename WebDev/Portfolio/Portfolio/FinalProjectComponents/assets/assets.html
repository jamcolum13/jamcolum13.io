 Welcome to BatCat, where the truth about feline energy suckers are revealed. For too long, cats have operated under a veil of adorable deception, draining our vitality and plotting their world domination. I, a victim of two such energy thieves, am here to expose their nefarious schemes. Join me in this fight against the fluffy overlords.

We're Cat Truth Seekers (CTS), a group of people who've had enough! We know cats aren't just cute. They're plotting something. My cats, Leo and April, are living proof. They sleep all day, but I'm always exhausted. We're here to tell the world the truth, and help others who are being drained. We're the only ones brave enough to say it! If you have been searching for the truth behind cats search no more, we are here to speak the reality of these creatures who take so much from us and live lavishly with no worries.

For Mikey the first orange fuzzy feline we had ever got! 
    
My dads dumb friend who we let stay over left the doors open and he ran away. We made the guy look for him but he never found him. Who knows if he even looked for him. It happened when I had school. He most likely left to meet up with his secret cat army. He would always run out and we would find him around other cats, likely his cat army allies.
