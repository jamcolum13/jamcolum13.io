<p> My cat Leo and sometimes his sister April steal my energy. I feel so drained after spending my time with them. I notice it every day from the mornings when i open my eyes and am joined by my favorite chunky orange feline who just wants to stay sleeping right next to me and makes me never want to leave the bed, to the second i get home where i have 2 cats crying for food acting like they've never seen a piece of meow mix in their lives. All they do is depend on me to fuel up by absorbing all my energy.   
</p>      
      
<p>It all started with Leo. We got him around two years ago around the same time I noticed I was starting to lose energy. It started on day one. I remember I had homework and chores to do but when we get home with the new little guy I'm sitting down petting him while he gets comfy on top of me and the next thing i'm waking up and the sun is up. Till that day staying up all night playing video games or watching youtube for hours came like nothing, it was second nature. Now since that day he's always chilling with me, taking all my energy.
</p>      
      
<p>And as if one wasn't enough a couple months ago we took in a stray leos sister april. She literally came out of nowhere. We found her outside of our house because this dude came outside, and he wanted us to help him turn on a lime scooter. And he was acting dumb,he was likely intoxicated, and he fake cried about the scooter, so my buddy helped him with the scooter while me and my dad were in the middle of this dilemma with this tiny little kitty. My dad was instantly obsessed. We thought it was a bunny, but the bunnies run away. As she kept walking towards us my dad was instantly drawn as he passed her to me so he could bring her food and water.
</p>
      
<p>Before April one cat was manageable and Leo was already a threat to my peace with his tomfoolery and desire to steal all my energy even go as far as take up all the space in the bed like he owns the place. Just so they can be lazy fat cats they are created this way if they aren't allowed to be lazy for all we know they could turn into gremlins and horrific creatures. They are storing as much energy as they can so that they and all the rest of their evil cat companions can finally storm the world and take over.
      </p>      

<p>They come to me, in my room and they chill in my bed. My orange cat Leo, he just comes into my room and sleeps, so I gotta bother him and I gotta stop him before he's all peaceful, cause there's no stopping them after that. But after a while something inside me just gives up, and I lay near him, and he just gives me a look like he knows what he did. Another thing is I have my upright bass in the bag.The cats will climb it, they scratch at it, they don't like it when i do activities, but it's only me. Some people think it's because cats have an interest in human activities, but I know the truth. THEY'RE OUT TO GET ME!! They are definitely part of a secret cat society i even found a bat man mask in my cats stuff , like where could he even get this from . evidence prof with a pic  </p>

<p>I think he's secretly part of a secret superhero society. Nothing's making sense. He's just a cat. How can he even get a mask? The lazy little guy doesn't even have a job or anything. Maybe he liked the Batman poster or comics I had in my room. Can cats even read ???? Because there's no explanation to how he even knows who Batman is, I only thought he understood  the word food. Eventually hell get to the point of brain power from all this energy he's stealing from me. If we want to save the human race and are planet from these creatures we have to come together and acknowledge the real danger they bring.</p>
