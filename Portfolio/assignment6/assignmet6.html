      <h1>Jeff The Land Shark Buff Opinions </h1>
    
    <h2>Aromatic-Ordinary-97 </h2>    
    <p>
      I’m not gonna lie—Jeff’s ultimate needs a buff. Right now, it’s way too easy to dodge. Characters like Dagger can use their abilities to avoid it, and not just them, but their teammates too. I’ve lost so many fights because of this.

Back when Marvel Rivals first came out, Jeff was my main. His ultimate used to be much more effective—you could hit 4 or 5 enemies easily. But now, I’m lucky if I get 3. It just doesn’t feel as strong anymore.

And here’s something wild—Jeff can actually dodge another Jeff’s ult! If you time it perfectly and burrow underground just before the enemy Jeff starts his ult and his ult start eating everyone, you can avoid it completely. I’ve tested it, and it’s crazy.</p>
      
<p>
How to Buff Jeff: Make his ult harder to dodge. Some characters should still be able to avoid it, but right now, over 35% of the charters can counter it—that’s too many.
Improve his healing. Jeff’s healing is one of the weakest in the game. His ultimate should create a rain cloud that heals teammates.
Fix the bubbles. Either increase the number of bubbles or lower the cooldown when picking one up.
Bonus Idea (Not a Buff, but Would Be Awesome!): There should be a feature where you can pet Jeff. Imagine an emote where, if Jeff activates it, other players can walk up, press a button, and pet him. That would be adorable!
That’s my idea—hope you like it!

      <h1> My personal opinion for Jeff buffs </h1>
        <p id="second">
        I personaly agree with Aromatic-Ordinary-97. I would say almost every point they bring up is correct. when im playing as jeff the first thing i notice is sometimes the heals could be more powerful but it does go through your teamates to allow for multiple heals. Second his bubbles are very effective but i find that when i need to use them all it takes forever to get them back when im constantly healing myself and the team. Lastly i feel like jeffs ult is definetley in need of a buff, in seson 0 his unltimate was instant and now there is a huge delay that sometimes ruin any play your trying to do.
      </p>

        How i think Jeff should get buffed: To start off they can strengthen his heal that would ve very helpful in some intense moments. Second i think they could make his hide and seek passive more clean by allowing him not to get stuck at stupid little spots. Third i think his bubbles really do need a faster reload time its honestly crazy its like 8-10 seconds per bubble and these charecters take in damage like crazy so you find yourself running out fast and needing them asap. Lastly they should maybe lessen the amount of time that delays jeffs ult use, when you activate his ult and choose to use it i find most the time the delay on it causes me to miss my targets ot gives them time to escape and spread out. I also think the petting jeff emote would be peak because
