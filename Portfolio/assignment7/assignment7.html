We're Cat Truth Seekers (CTS), a group of people who've had enough! We know cats aren't just cute. They're plotting something. My cats, Leo and April, are living proof. They sleep all day, but I'm always exhausted. We're here to tell the world the truth, and help others who are being drained. We're the only ones brave enough to say it! If you have been searching for the truth behind cats search no more, we are here to speak the reality of these creatures who take so much from us and live lavishly with no worries.

My cat Leo and sometimes his sister April steal my energy. I feel so drained after spending my time with them. I notice it every day from the mornings when i open my eyes and am joined by my favorite chunky orange feline who just wants to stay sleeping right next to me and makes me never want to leave the bed, to the second i get home where i have 2 cats crying for food acting like they've never seen a piece of meow mix in their lives. All they do is depend on me to fuel up by absorbing all my energy.
