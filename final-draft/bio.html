<p> I am Leo, I am almost 4 years old! This is my third
	 home I have been known to be a trouble maker but 
	 these humans have accepted me, they do whatever I 
	 demand. I love to eat food and sleep. I enjoy treats
	  and doing a bunch of nothing. But my sister April 
	  always wants to bother me when I want to chill. 
	  Leo is a charismatic and confident feline. He exudes a regal aura, demanding attention and admiration from all who enter his domain. Known for his dramatic flair, Leo enjoys being the center of attention and will go to great lengths to ensure his presence is acknowledged.

	full year old ! These humans are very nice they found
	 me starving and kept me and have taken care of me
	  since! Although they always get irritated when I 
	  wake them up in the middle of the night . And Leo
	   is so lazy he never wants to play . April is a 
	   calm and observant feline, preferring to stay in 
	   the background and gather information. She has a 
	   keen intellect and is always analyzing her 
	   surroundings. Despite her quiet demeanor, April is

<p> My Name is Julian! I am 21 years old and I have been
	 getting harassed  by these monsters since day one 
	 . At first they seem like cute cuddley creatures 
	 but man I was wrong don’t make the same mistake as 
	 me. "I thought I was adopting pets, but it seems 
	 they've adopted me. These creatures are not as 
	 innocent as they appear. I've witnessed 
	 things—strange behaviors, odd occurrences. I can't
	  ignore it any longer. The truth must be known."
