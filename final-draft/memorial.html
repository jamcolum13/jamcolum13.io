<p> This is for mikey my original cat companion. 
He liked to go outside and fight and wonders of the world. 
The last time I seen him was years ago i wonder how hes doing,
 i can only asume he started a secret cat society with the intent of 
world domination or somehitng as terrifying.     </p>

<p> TIt is believed that Mikey founded a clandestine 
	society of cats dedicated to global exploration and 
	influence. This secret organization, known only to 
	its members, operates from the shadows, with Mikey at 
	its helm. 

	Mikey was no ordinary cat. From a young age, he 
	exhibited an insatiable curiosity and a fearless 
	nature. Unlike most indoor cats, Mikey preferred the 
	great outdoors, where he would embark on daily 
	adventures, exploring every nook and cranny of the
	 neighborhood. His favorite pastimes included scaling
	  fences, chasing shadows, and engaging in epic 
	  battles with local wildlife.

	He was a master of stealth, often disappearing for
	 days without a trace, only to return with tales of
	  his exploitsâ€”or at least, that's what I imagined. 
	  His mysterious disappearances and reappearances 
	  added to his enigmatic persona.
